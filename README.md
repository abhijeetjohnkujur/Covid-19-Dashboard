The website contains the information related to overview detail of the covid-19, This website also shows how covid-19 is contagious with the help of cards. Also the website shows the information regarding the covid-19 symptoms with help of diagram.

<h2 id="ch">Challenges</h2>

<i>As a whole this project was fun doing. Through out this assignment duration I came to know many technologies such as gatsby and learned abouts its plugins and also laearned to implement css modules. The challenge which I faced the most was to make the web app compatible with almost all screen sizes and making the web look exactly the same as the mockup one. Implementation of some the figma assets and making it fit inside the screen was also a challenge for me. The web is not 100% replica of the covid-19 figma mockup but I hope that I provied you with a decent output.</i>
